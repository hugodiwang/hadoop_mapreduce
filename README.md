# hadoop_mapreduce
This is the final project of my big data Bootcamp. In this BootCamp, I implemented an #HDFS system(4 virtual machines, HA style, 2 NameNode, 3 JournalNode, 3 #ZooKeeper) and a #Yarn system(2 resource managers, 3 node manager, HA style). After building it, I wrote a topn java mapreduce code and deployed it to my hadoop. This topn code is to find two days with the highest temperature in our dataset.
